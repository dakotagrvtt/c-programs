cpu-burst - Amount of time the process uses the processor before it is no longer ready

timeslice - discrete, finite unit of time (seconds). For cpu-scheduling equal time slices are called quanta (plural of quantum).

Context switch - process in which the context of the current proces is saved, the CPU is deallocated from that process, and allocated to a new process (and new context is loaded). Significantly expensive operation.
